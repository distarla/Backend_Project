# FLAG - BackEnd Project
## Event Management API

This project aims to build an API to serve the previously made Event Management Application during the FrontEnd Project. It was made already thinking in the developments of the application going further and so it added features to the previously created ones.
The full documentation of this project can be found in {link in your email inbox}.

### The Stack

This project was built using Laravel 9.19 (with php 8.0.2) and MySQL, running in a DAMP local server (Docker Apache MySQL PHP). This local server was built using the repository from theandersonn (https://github.com/theandersonn/docker-apache-php7-mysql) and upgrading php7 to php8.
The Authentication part of the API was built using JSON Web Token Authentication for Laravel (JWT).
All of the endpoints tests were made using Postman.

This project was developed using git and GitHub for version control and Trello for project control.

### Work Evaluation

As this course went by, my struggles became far different.
Having recently entered my first position as a Junior Developer, I feel I have a little bit more experience dealing with the technical struggles presented.
On the other hand, because of that and also my personal struggles, my time and energy became really reduced to a minimum so I feel I didnÂ´t absorbed the last bit of the course so well (mainly the REST API and NODE modules) and my effort to get this project done was enormous.
With that said, I have to say the complexity and dimension of the project are not what I was hopping to do and know I can do but was what I had time to do. As for the Autonomy, Goals reached and data modeling I believe these were points were I did well even if I believe the choice of not relating the events with the price is not the best. The reality is that I didn't have the time to explore other alternative like using some sort of has many through alternative. The quality of the code, I think could be better as I struggled a bit with the php syntax and the documentation I believe it could be improved since it was the first time I attempted to write an API documentation.
With all things considered I believe the project deserves a 15.
